# UFOs: Alone in the Universe?

## Overview of the Analysis
Are we really alone in our universe?  Many individuals would definitively say yes, but not everybody is completely convinced.  Over the last century, there have been countless numbers of UFO sightings accross the globe that have been well documented, and our client, Dana, wants to learn more.  We are going to help Dana by creating a new, interactive HTML website that will provide users with a brief overview of the debate around aliens and UFOs, and will also provide users with a useful search tool to research some of the sightings that have taken place here in the United States, thus allowing all who care to know the ability to draw their own conclusions.  

The webpage will be created using several of the most useful tools in JavaScript linked to an HTML file that will allow us to set up the site to Dana's thinking.  The final result will be an interactive webpage that includes components such as a page header with image, a data table, searh filters, and more that is easy to navigate and interpret.
  
## Results
The most critical element of the webpage needed to be the search filters.  Dana wanted to be sure that the user could easily refine the overall data information based upon the date, city, state, country, and the shape (what was observed).

To the right of the search filters will be a complete list of the data available to the user.
