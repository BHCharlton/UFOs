# UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?

## Overview of the Analysis
Are we really alone in our universe?  Many individuals would definitively say yes, but not everybody is completely convinced.  Over the last century, there have been countless numbers of UFO sightings across the globe that have been well documented, and our client, Dana, wants to learn more.  We are going to help Dana by creating a new, interactive HTML website that will provide users with a brief overview of the debate around aliens and UFOs along with a useful search tool to research some of the sightings that have taken place here in the United States, thus allowing all who care to know the ability to draw their own conclusions.  

The webpage will be created using several of the most useful tools in JavaScript linked to an HTML file that will allow us to set up the site to Dana's thinking.  The final result will be an interactive webpage that includes components such as a page header with image, a data table, search filters, and more that is easy to navigate and interpret.
  
## Results
The most critical element of the webpage needed to be the search filters.  Dana wanted to be sure that the user could easily refine the overall data information based upon the date, city, state, country, and the shape.  Search boxes are added to the far left of the page for the user to type in their search criteria.

To the right of the search boxes will be a complete, unfiltered list of the data available to the user.

Finally, the user can type in the specific information they want to obtain using the search boxes.  They can search by any number of filters desired, and the results will be updated accordingly after pressing enter.  Here is an example of the search results when the date was set for 1/11/2010 with Florida as the state.

Each box can be individually cleared and updated as many times as needed if the user would like to refine their search.

## Summary

While the website we have created for Dana is certainly a good first step and provides the user with useful search tools, there are still a few drawbacks to the page that could be improved upon:
* A "Clear All" button so that a new search can be quickly started without having to delete previously entered search information
* An auto-fill function that will give the user available search options as they type
* A "No results" output is displayed to ensure the user that the search was completed without errors
* A larger search database linked to online resources
